# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis

An interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The live deployed webpage can be found here: [Biodiversity dashboard](https://vmratcliff.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity-Analysis/)

The dashboard has three interactive charts that are updated whenever a new sample is selected.

* A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* A bubble chart that displays each sample.

* A Gauge Chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

Additionally, the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information is also displayed on the dashboard for each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.
